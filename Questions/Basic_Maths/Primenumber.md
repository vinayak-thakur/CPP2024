Detailed Explanation:

1. **Function `prime(int n)`**:
    - The function `prime` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `true` if the number is prime, otherwise `false`.

2. **Base Cases**:
    - `if(n == 1 || n == 0)`: 
        - If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns `false` because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
    
3. **Loop (Checking for Factors)**:
    - `for(int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++)`: 
        - This loop iterates from `i = 2` to `sqrt(n)`. The upper limit of the loop is set to `sqrt(n)` because any factor larger than `sqrt(n)` would have a corresponding factor smaller than `sqrt(n)`. For example, if `n = 25`, its divisors are 1, 5, and 25, and the square root of 25 is 5, so we only need to check up to 5.
        
    - **Condition `if(n % i == 0)`**:
        - If `n` is divisible by `i`, it means that `n` has a factor other than 1 and itself, so it is not a prime number. The function returns `false` in this case.

4. **Returning True**:
    - If no factors are found in the loop, the function returns `true`, indicating that the number is prime.

5. **Main Function**:
    - `n = 25` (Sample Input): 
        - The function `prime` is called with `n = 25`.
    - The result is stored in the variable `ans`.
    - The result is printed using a ternary operator: 
        - If `ans` is `true`, it prints "True"; otherwise, it prints "False".

**Dry Run for Input `n = 25`**:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Input: `n = 25`
    - Call `prime(25)`.

2. **Base Case Check**:
    - `n == 1 || n == 0`: This condition is `false` for `n = 25`, so the function proceeds to the next step.

3. **Loop Execution**:
    - `for(int i = 2; i <= sqrt(25); i++)`: 
        - `sqrt(25) = 5`, so the loop will run from `i = 2` to `i = 5`.
    
    **First Iteration**:
    - `i = 2`:
        - `25 % 2 != 0`: The remainder is not zero, so the loop continues.
    
    **Second Iteration**:
    - `i = 3`:
        - `25 % 3 != 0`: The remainder is not zero, so the loop continues.

    **Third Iteration**:
    - `i = 4`:
        - `25 % 4 != 0`: The remainder is not zero, so the loop continues.
    
    **Fourth Iteration**:
    - `i = 5`:
        - `25 % 5 == 0`: The remainder is zero, meaning 25 is divisible by 5. The function returns `false` because 25 has a divisor other than 1 and itself.

4. **Result**:
    - `ans = false` (25 is not a prime number).
    - The ternary operator prints "False".

**Time Complexity**:
- The time complexity of the function is `O(sqrt(n))` because we only check divisibility up to `sqrt(n)`. This reduces the number of iterations significantly compared to checking all numbers from 2 to `n-1`.

**Space Complexity**:
- The space complexity is `O(1)` since no extra space is used apart from a few variables.
