Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the first element. This process continues until the entire array is sorted. Â  

Algorithm:

Iterate through the array:
For each element at index i:
Assume the current element is the minimum.
Iterate through the remaining unsorted elements (from index i+1 to the end):
If a smaller element is found, update the minimum index.
If the minimum element is not at index i, swap it with the element at index i.
Example:

Let's sort the array [6, 8, 4, 2, 10] using selection sort.

Initial Array:

6 8 4 2 10
Pass 1:

i = 0:
The minimum element is 2.
Swap 6 and 2.
2 8 4 6 10
Pass 2:

i = 1:
The minimum element is 4.
Swap 8 and 4.
2 4 8 6 10
Pass 3:

i = 2:
The minimum element is 6.
Swap 8 and 6.
2 4 6 8 10
Pass 4:

i = 3:
The minimum element is 10.
No swap needed.
Final Sorted Array:

2 4 6 8 10
Detailed Explanation:

Pass 1:

The algorithm starts with the first element (6) and assumes it's the minimum.
It then compares 6 with the remaining elements: 8, 4, 2, and 10.
The smallest element found is 2.
Since 2 is not the first element, it's swapped with 6.
Pass 2:

Now, the first two elements (2, 4) are sorted.
The algorithm moves to the second element (4) and assumes it's the minimum.
It compares 4 with the remaining elements: 8, 6, and 10.
The smallest element found is 6.
Since 6 is not the second element, it's swapped with 4.
Pass 3:

The first three elements (2, 4, 6) are now sorted.
The algorithm moves to the third element (6) and assumes it's the minimum.
It compares 6 with the remaining elements: 8 and 10.
The smallest element found is 8.
Since 8 is already in the correct position, no swap is needed.
Pass 4:

The first four elements (2, 4, 6, 8) are sorted.
The algorithm moves to the fourth element (8) and assumes it's the minimum.
There's only one element left (10), so it remains the minimum.
Since 10 is already in the correct position, no swap is needed.
Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(n^2) (occurs when the array is already sorted)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Space Complexity:

O(1) (in-place sorting)
