```
1. **Base Condition**:
    - The function `countPrimes` starts by checking whether `n` is either 0 or 1 with the condition `if(n == 0 || n == 1) return 0;`. This is because there are no prime numbers less than or equal to 1. Prime numbers are defined as natural numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Therefore, if `n` is 0 or 1, the function immediately returns 0 as no prime numbers exist in this range.

2. **Array Initialization**:
    - `vector<int> array(n, true);` creates a vector `array` of size `n`, where each element is initialized to `true`. The reason for initializing all values to `true` is because initially, we assume all numbers from 0 to `n-1` might be prime. This array is used as a sieve, where `true` means the number at that index is still considered prime, and `false` means it has been marked as a non-prime.
    
    - `array[0] = array[1] = false;` explicitly sets the first two elements, `array[0]` and `array[1]`, to `false`. This is because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers by definition. 0 has no positive divisors other than itself, and 1 has exactly one divisor, failing the definition of a prime.

3. **Outer Loop (Checking Primes)**:
    - The main logic of the algorithm is contained within the outer loop: `for(int i = 2; i < n; i++)`. This loop iterates over each number `i` from 2 up to `n-1`. The number 2 is the smallest prime number, so we start checking for primes from 2 onward. 
   
    - **Condition `if(array[i])`:** This checks if `array[i]` is still marked as `true`. If it is, then the number `i` is considered prime. If `array[i] == false`, it means that the number `i` has been marked as a non-prime (i.e., it's a multiple of some smaller prime number), and we skip further processing for this number.

4. **Counting Primes**:
    - If the number `i` is prime (`array[i] == true`), we increment the prime counter `ans++`. This variable keeps track of how many prime numbers we have encountered so far.

5. **Inner Loop (Marking Multiples)**:
    - Once we identify a prime number `i`, we need to mark all of its multiples as non-prime since any multiple of a prime number cannot be a prime itself.
    
    - The inner loop `for(int j = 2*i; j < n; j = j + i)` starts at `j = 2*i` because the first multiple of `i` greater than `i` is `2*i`. The loop increments `j` by `i` in each iteration, marking all subsequent multiples of `i` (i.e., `3*i`, `4*i`, and so on) up to `n-1` as non-prime.
    
    - In each iteration of this inner loop, `array[j] = false;` marks the number `j` as non-prime by setting `array[j]` to `false`. This ensures that the next time the outer loop encounters the number `j`, it will be skipped because it is no longer considered prime.

6. **Returning the Result**:
    - After both loops have finished processing, all numbers in the range from 2 to `n-1` will either be marked as prime (`true`) or non-prime (`false`). The variable `ans` will now contain the total count of prime numbers less than `n`.
    
    - The function returns this value, `return ans;`.

7. **Main Function**:
    - In the `main` function, the user is prompted to input a value for `n`. This value is passed to the `countPrimes` function, which calculates and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. The result is then printed to the console.


Let's perform a dry run for `n = 10`:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Input: `n = 10`
    - `array = [false, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true]`
    - Here, `array[0]` and `array[1]` are set to `false` because 0 and 1 are not prime. All other elements are initialized to `true`, assuming all numbers from 2 to 9 are prime initially.
    - `ans = 0` (initial count of primes)

2. **Outer Loop (i = 2)**:
    - `array[2] == true` (2 is prime), so increment `ans`: `ans = 1`
    - Now, mark all multiples of 2 as non-prime:
      - `array[4] = false` (4 is a multiple of 2)
      - `array[6] = false` (6 is a multiple of 2)
      - `array[8] = false` (8 is a multiple of 2)
    - The updated array: `[false, false, true, true, false, true, false, true, false, true]`

3. **Outer Loop (i = 3)**:
    - `array[3] == true` (3 is prime), so increment `ans`: `ans = 2`
    - Now, mark all multiples of 3 as non-prime:
      - `array[6] = false` (already marked)
      - `array[9] = false` (9 is a multiple of 3)
    - The updated array: `[false, false, true, true, false, true, false, true, false, false]`

4. **Outer Loop (i = 4)**:
    - `array[4] == false` (4 is not prime), so skip.

5. **Outer Loop (i = 5)**:
    - `array[5] == true` (5 is prime), so increment `ans`: `ans = 3`
    - Since 5 has no multiples less than 10, no further marking is needed.

6. **Outer Loop (i = 6)**:
    - `array[6] == false` (6 is not prime), so skip.

7. **Outer Loop (i = 7)**:
    - `array[7] == true` (7 is prime), so increment `ans`: `ans = 4`
    - Since 7 has no multiples less than 10, no further marking is needed.

8. **Outer Loop (i = 8)**:
    - `array[8] == false` (8 is not prime), so skip.

9. **Outer Loop (i = 9)**:
    - `array[9] == false` (9 is not prime), so skip.

**Final Result**:
- The total count of prime numbers less than 10 is `ans = 4`.
- The prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, and 7.
