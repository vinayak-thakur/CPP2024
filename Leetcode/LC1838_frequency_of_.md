### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
    - We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We can perform at most `k` operations where we increment any element by 1. The goal is to maximize the frequency of any element in the array.
    - We want to find the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most `k` operations.

2. **Approach**:
    - The strategy is to sort the array and then try to increase smaller elements to match the larger ones. 
    - We maintain a sliding window to represent the group of elements that we are trying to make equal. The window is defined by two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right).
    - We attempt to increase all elements in the window to match the value of the largest element in the window (nums[r]). 
    - We can only do this if the sum of the elements in the window (after k increments) is less than or equal to the required total sum.
    
    - **Step 1**: 
        - Sort the array in non-decreasing order so that we can try to make the smaller elements equal to larger ones.

    - **Step 2**: 
        - Use a sliding window to group the elements that can potentially be made equal to nums[r] with at most `k` operations.
    
    - **Step 3**:
        - Check if the window is valid by calculating the required total sum for making all elements equal to nums[r].
        - If the window is invalid (i.e., we need more than `k` operations), shrink the window by moving the left pointer (`l`) to the right.
    
    - **Step 4**:
        - Keep track of the size of the largest valid window, which will give us the maximum frequency of any element.
    
    - The main idea is that if the current window's total sum is greater than what can be achieved by `k` increments, we need to shrink the window from the left.

### Dry Run for Example 1:

**Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 4]`, `k = 5`

1. **Initialization**:
   - After sorting: `nums = [1, 2, 4]`
   - `l = 0`, `r = 0`, `res = 0`, `total = 0`

2. **Step 1 (r = 0)**:
   - Add `nums[0] = 1` to `total`: `total = 1`
   - The window size is `r - l + 1 = 1`.
   - The required sum to make all elements in the window equal to `nums[0] = 1` is `1 * 1 = 1` (valid).
   - Update `res = max(res, 1) = 1`.
   - Move `r` to the next element.

3. **Step 2 (r = 1)**:
   - Add `nums[1] = 2` to `total`: `total = 3`
   - The window size is `r - l + 1 = 2`.
   - The required sum to make all elements in the window equal to `nums[1] = 2` is `2 * 2 = 4` (valid because `total + k = 3 + 5 = 8`).
   - Update `res = max(res, 2) = 2`.
   - Move `r` to the next element.

4. **Step 3 (r = 2)**:
   - Add `nums[2] = 4` to `total`: `total = 7`
   - The window size is `r - l + 1 = 3`.
   - The required sum to make all elements in the window equal to `nums[2] = 4` is `3 * 4 = 12` (valid because `total + k = 7 + 5 = 12`).
   - Update `res = max(res, 3) = 3`.

**Final Result**: `res = 3` (we can make all elements equal to 4).

### Dry Run for Example 2:

**Input**: `nums = [1, 4, 8, 13]`, `k = 5`

1. **Initialization**:
   - After sorting: `nums = [1, 4, 8, 13]`
   - `l = 0`, `r = 0`, `res = 0`, `total = 0`

2. **Step 1 (r = 0)**:
   - Add `nums[0] = 1` to `total`: `total = 1`
   - The window size is `r - l + 1 = 1`.
   - The required sum to make all elements in the window equal to `nums[0] = 1` is `1 * 1 = 1` (valid).
   - Update `res = max(res, 1) = 1`.
   - Move `r` to the next element.

3. **Step 2 (r = 1)**:
   - Add `nums[1] = 4` to `total`: `total = 5`
   - The window size is `r - l + 1 = 2`.
   - The required sum to make all elements in the window equal to `nums[1] = 4` is `2 * 4 = 8` (valid because `total + k = 5 + 5 = 10`).
   - Update `res = max(res, 2) = 2`.
   - Move `r` to the next element.

4. **Step 3 (r = 2)**:
   - Add `nums[2] = 8` to `total`: `total = 13`
   - The window size is `r - l + 1 = 3`.
   - The required sum to make all elements in the window equal to `nums[2] = 8` is `3 * 8 = 24` (invalid because `total + k = 13 + 5 = 18`).
   - Shrink the window from the left (`l = 1`, `total = 12`).

5. **Step 4**:
   - Continue adjusting window for further elements.

**Final Result**: `res = 2`.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step. The sliding window and updates take `O(n)`.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is `O(1)` because we only use a few extra variables (ignoring input array).
